"""The spatial reaction-diffusion model class simulator (spec: ``spatial-class``).

Reprolith's sixth model class: PDE models over space and time — morphogen gradients, growth fronts,
tissue-scale distribution. The reproducible result is a concentration profile over space, so this
class reuses the curve oracle (:func:`reprolith.judge_curve`) unchanged and specializes only the
simulator: an explicit finite-difference solver for 1-D diffusion with optional first-order reaction
(decay/production) terms.

Like the logical and stochastic classes, the solver is exact-scheme and dependency-free — pure
Python — so this class carries no deferred engine. It is deterministic under its pinned
discretization, and rejects a time step that violates the explicit scheme's stability limit rather
than producing a diverging profile (spec: "Discretization is part of the protocol").
